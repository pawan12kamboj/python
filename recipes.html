           <i>Who can resist a fresh salad ! Here's one of my favorites.</i>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The greens should be completely dry:</strong><font color="red"> No matter what kind of greens you use, they should be as dry as possible. If greens aren't dry, they feel weighed down and even a little slimy when the dressing is added. I like to buy bags of mixed salad greens <i>(sure, I could make my own mix, but I don't always have the time or inclination to buy frisee, radicchio, romaine, arugula, and butter lettuce and wash and chop them myself!)</i>, but these should be washed too.</li></font> 
          <li><strong>The greens should be bite-sized:</strong> <font color="darkblue">Really Make sure the greens are torn into bite-sized bits. I really hate those oversized wedges of lettuce left in restaurant salads; you have to cut them up to get them in your mouth! No good.</li></font>
          <li><strong>Put the greens in a really big bowl:</strong><font color="darkgreen">This gives you space to dress the salad without splashing or compressing all the air out of what should be a light, fluffy mix of greens. </li> </font>
          <li><strong>Add any other vegetables you like:</strong> <font color="#242582">Herbs are extra-good. For a really simple salad, this is where you toss in any little extras. I don't like to over-complicate my side salads or weigh them down with lots of heavy vegetables. But sometimes I add a little carrot or cucumber, finely shredded and blotted dry. Finely shredded herbs are wonderful in salad too; I'm partial to mint.</li></font>
          <li><strong>Always dress your salad:</strong> Bottles at the table no. All right. Here's my salad manifesto. I don't believe that salads should ever ever be dressed at the table by the diners. A good salad is not a pile of vegetables with gloppy dressing on top. A good salad has dressing mixed all throughout, and a dressing calibrated to the salad itself. I know some might disagree with this, but I'm positively militant about it! Salad should never come to the party naked.</li>
         <li><strong>Most dressings need a touch of sweetness:</strong> <font color="#553D67">In salad dressing, sweetness should always be a deliberate part of the equation. Sometimes you deliberately leave it out, balancing the dressing with something funky and strong, like Amanda Hesser's anchovies in her French dressing. But I find that just oil and vinegar lack a little something, unless you are working with really terrific oil and aged balsamic. A half teaspoon of honey or maple syrup won't sweeten the dressing noticeably; it will just make it taste more rounded and full.</li></font>
         <li><strong>Taste the dressing first:</strong><font color="darkpink"> Always taste the dressing before you pour it on the salad. Adjust if you want a little more acidity or sweetness.</li></font>
         <li><strong>Use far less dressing than you think you need:</strong> <font color="purple">Here I used all the dressing, but I wish I would have actually used less<i> (and there's only 2 tablespoons of oil here!)</i>. You want to lightly dress the salad, not drench it.</li></font>
         <li><strong>Salt and pepper! Now for perhaps the most important part of a well-dressed salad:</strong> <font color="red">Salt and pepper. This is what that flaky salt in your cupboard is for.</li></font>
         <li><strong>Add any other mix-ins, such as nuts, cheese, or other dressy things:</strong><font color="darkblue">I like to serve salad in individual bowls and sprinkle any last-minute grace notes like a shaving of Parmesan or some slivered nuts directly on top. This makes them look finished and pretty, and it also is a good way to make sure that these heavy ingredients don't fall immediately to the bottom of the salad. If you don't use any other garnishes, I like to add just a touch more pepper on top.</li></font>

        <h2>Pizza</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Pawanpreet Kaur\Desktop\pizza.jpg" alt="pizza image" width=320>
       <p>
        <i>Pizza, the king of comfort foods. Try this simple, taste sensation.</i>
       </p>
       <ol>
          <li><strong>Make the base:</strong><font color="DARKGREEN"> Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in<u> 200ml</u> warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for <u>5 mins</u> until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it is not essential for a thin crust.</font></li>
          <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong><font color="#242582"> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li></font>
          <li><strong>Roll out the dough:</strong><font color="#553D67">If you have let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about<u> 25cm </u>across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li></font>
          <li><strong>Top and bake:</strong><font color="purple">Heat oven to <u>240C/fan 220C /gas 8</u>. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for <u>8-10 mins</u> until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li></font>
